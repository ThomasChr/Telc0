If one happens to keep the original history, and in general:

I do apologize for my rather unprofessional und childish behavior when writing commit messages, foremost but not limited to my message of:

I am deeply sorry for the flame (esp. for my friend I targeted there).
I suppose a GameJam and working with a bit of too much enthusiasm does not only offer to extend one's expertise and knowledge in technology but also allows to learn a thing or two about oneself.

The most important part of such a Jam should be to have together while hacking away some stuff <3

Even after my little spoiling of the fun - which honestly did not come with any worse intentions, but to be bantering between friends.
I do understand however that some people may like to use such projects for future references, especially for building a professional portfolio.

I did honestly not have that in mind (which I should have - since someones career or career path may be interfered with such unprofessional behavior).

We had a discussion about that :) redid the history for the most offensive parts. If one may still think some comments and or commit messages may be too vulgar / please keep the respective author in mind - and please DO NOT TAKE ME TOO SERIOUSLY!
